# YouTube Sentiment Analysis

This project involves analyzing the sentiment of comments from YouTube videos. The goal is to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and related files.
- `results/`: Directory to store the results of the analysis, including plots and metrics.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- tensorflow or pytorch (depending on the chosen model)
- jupyter

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Collection

1. **API Access**: Use the YouTube Data API to collect comments from specific videos or channels. You'll need to set up an API key from Google Cloud Platform.
2. **Scraping**: Alternatively, use web scraping techniques to gather comments if API access is limited.

Example code to collect comments using the YouTube Data API:

```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

def get_comments(video_id, api_key):
    youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey=api_key)
    request = youtube.commentThreads().list(
        part='snippet',
        videoId=video_id,
        maxResults=100
    )
    response = request.execute()
    
    comments = []
    for item in response['items']:
        comment = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['textOriginal']
        comments.append(comment)
    
    return comments
```

## Data Preprocessing

- **Text Cleaning**: Remove URLs, HTML tags, special characters, and stop words.
- **Tokenization**: Split comments into individual words or tokens.
- **Lemmatization/Stemming**: Reduce words to their base or root form.

Example preprocessing steps using NLTK:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Remove URLs and special characters
    text = re.sub(r"http\S+|www\S+|https\S+", '', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    text = re.sub(r'\@\w+|\#','', text)
    
    # Tokenize
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    
    # Remove stop words
    tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stopwords.words('english')]
    
    # Lemmatize
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens]
    
    return ' '.join(tokens)
```

## Sentiment Analysis

- **Traditional Machine Learning**: Use algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or Logistic Regression with TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer features.
- **Deep Learning**: Use models like LSTM, GRU, or Transformers (e.g., BERT) for more complex sentiment analysis.

Example using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load and preprocess data
comments = [...]  # Load your comments
labels = [...]    # Load your labels

# TF-IDF Vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(comments)
y = labels

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize the results with confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Usage

To run the analysis, execute the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory or run the scripts in the `src/` directory. Modify the configuration files as needed to specify input data paths, model parameters, and other settings.

## Future Work

- Improve preprocessing steps by incorporating more sophisticated text normalization techniques.
- Experiment with advanced deep learning models for better performance.
- Add support for multilingual sentiment analysis.
- Develop a web application to visualize sentiment trends over time.
